    "In this tutorial, you will build a basic chatbot. This chatbot is the basis for the following series of tutorials where you will progressively add more sophisticated capabilities, and be introduced to key LangGraph concepts along the way. Let's dive in! 🌟\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have access to a LLM that supports\n",
    "tool-calling features, such as [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys),\n",
    "[Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), or\n",
    "[Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).\n",

    "## 1. Install packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U langgraph langsmith\n",

    "## 2. Create a `StateGraph`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can create a basic chatbot using LangGraph. This chatbot will respond directly to user messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a `StateGraph`. A `StateGraph` object defines the structure of our chatbot as a \"state machine\". We'll add `nodes` to represent the llm and functions our chatbot can call and `edges` to specify how the bot should transition between these functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our graph can now handle two key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each `node` can receive the current `State` as input and output an update to the state.\n",
    "2. Updates to `messages` will be appended to the existing list rather than overwriting it, thanks to the prebuilt reducer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! tip \"Concept\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    When defining a graph, the first step is to define its `State`. The `State` includes the graph's schema and [reducer functions](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#reducers) that handle state updates. In our example, `State` is a schema with one key: `messages`. The reducer function is used to append new messages to the list instead of overwriting it. Keys without a reducer annotation will overwrite previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To learn more about state, reducers, and related concepts, see [LangGraph reference docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** how the `chatbot` node function takes the current `State` as input and returns a dictionary containing an updated `messages` list under the key \"messages\". This is the basic pattern for all LangGraph node functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add_messages` function in our `State` will append the LLM's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\n",

    "# 3. Add memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot can now [use tools](./2-add-tools.md) to answer user questions, but it does not remember the context of previous interactions. This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph solves this problem through **persistent checkpointing**. If you provide a `checkpointer` when compiling the graph and a `thread_id` when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same `thread_id`, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see later that **checkpointing** is _much_ more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. But first, let's add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.\n",

    "LangGraph is likely a framework or library designed specifically for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities. Here are a few points to consider based on this recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reliability: The experts emphasize that LangGraph is more reliable than simpler autonomous agent approaches. This could mean it has better stability, error handling, or consistent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extensibility: LangGraph is described as more extensible, which suggests that it probably offers a flexible architecture that allows you to easily add new features or modify existing ones as your agent's requirements evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced capabilities: Given that it's recommended over \"simple autonomous agents,\" LangGraph likely provides more sophisticated tools and techniques for building complex AI agents.\n",
    "...\n",
    "2. Look for tutorials or guides specifically focused on building AI agents with LangGraph.\n",
    "3. Check if there are any community forums or discussion groups where you can ask questions and get support from other developers using LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like more specific information about LangGraph or have any questions about this recommendation, please feel free to ask, and I can request further assistance from the experts.\n",

    "3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.\n",
    "...\n",
    "6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent's decision-making process and workflow.\n",
    "7. Don't forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.\n",
    "\n",
